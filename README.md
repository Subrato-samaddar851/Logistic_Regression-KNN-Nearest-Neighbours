**Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors
**Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using two popular classification algorithms: Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The dataset used for this analysis is the BankChurners dataset. The objective is to gain practical experience in applying these algorithms and comparing their performances.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the BankChurners dataset, which contains customer information from a financial institution. It includes features such as transaction history, credit card usage, and demographic details. The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned or not.

Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression

A linear classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a customer churning.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a customer based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

Objectives

Apply Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors to predict customer churn.

Compare the performances of both models using evaluation metrics.

Gain hands-on experience with classification techniques and model evaluation.
